## APEX NO-RECOIL

A CLI based tool written in Python that helps to control recoil as much as possible with the use of recoil patterns. This is still a WIP so feedback and possible help especially with fine-tuning the recoil patterns would be appreciated.

## USAGE

1. Setup a virtual environment and install all packages in the requirements.txt file
2. Download  and install the Tesseract program here - [link](https://digi.bib.uni-mannheim.de/tesseract/tesseract-ocr-w64-setup-v5.0.0-alpha.20210811.exe)
3. Update **line 12** in **main.py** with the dir to where you installed the **tesseract.exe**
4. You should now be able to run the program in your venv using command - `py main.py`
